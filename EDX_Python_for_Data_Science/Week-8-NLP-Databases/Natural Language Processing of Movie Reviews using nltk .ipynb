      "films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . \n",
      "for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \n",
      "to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \n",
      "the book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \n",
      "in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . \n",
      "if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . \n",
      "getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \n",
      "the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . \n",
      "it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \n",
      "when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \n",
      "abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \n",
      "upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . \n",
      "i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \n",
      "in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \n",
      "it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \n",
      "and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( \" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? \" ) . \n",
      "don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . \n",
      "now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \n",
